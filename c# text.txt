Array trsaversal:-
        (1) insertion
        (2) selection
        (3) updation
        (4) deletion
        (5) sorting
        (6) searching

sorting
------------
arr=10 ,20,30,40,50,60
enter index:3.......40
enter element :80
if index==3
arr[3]=80

(2) multidimentional/2d Array
================================
this is used  for matrix representaion
we know that matrix is a combination of row and column nested for loop is used in 2d Array.
multiple square breacket are used to represent 2d array.

syntax.
=======
datatype[][] Array_name=new_Arrayname[size1][size2]

1 2 3   00 01 02
2 3 4 = 10 11 12
4 5 6   20 21 22

multiplication of two matrix:
=============================
1 2 * 1 2 = 1*1 + 2*3  =7  10
3 4   3 4   3*1 + 4*4  =15 22

(00*00) (01*10)    (00*01)  (01*11)
 1*1   + 2*3       1*2  +  2*4           =        7(00)    10 (01)
(10*00) (11*10)    (10*01)   (11*11)              15(10)   22 (11)
 3*1  +  4*3       3*2  +  4*4


for(r=0;r<2;r++){
    for(c=0;c<2;c++){
        sum1[r,c]=0;
        for(k=0;k<2;k++)
        {
            sum[r,c]+=mat1[r,k]*mat2[k,c];
        }
    }
}



string:
=======
String is a charector of array;
string also start with 0 to length-1;
In C# string datatype is used for string;
Syntax:
========
string String_name
i=0;str[i]!='\0';i++;v

Some predefine function of string;
===================================
length():
   This function used for count lengthof string;
ToUpper():
   This functionis used for Convert string in upper Case.
ToLower():
   This functionis used for Convert string in Lower Case.
Insert():
   This function is used for Insert charectoris string.
Remove():
   This function is used for Remove charector.
Concat():
   This function is used for join two String.
Trim():
   This functionis used for cut String'
Equals():v
   this function is used Compare two string.
IndexOf():
   This Function is used for Find index of participation Char.
Lastindexof():
    This function is used for find the last index of string;

 Function:
 =========
    Function is a block of code used to perform specific task
    Function provide reusability of code.
    in C# we can declare static and non static method.
    Types of method:
    ================


    Predefine method:
    ==================
       this method is already define in compiler or predefine class.
       Example:- WriteLine() ,ReadLine(),read()
    User definne method
    ===================
    This is used by user or programmer.
    Types of user define method:
    -----------------------------
     1)no return no passing parameter

           in this function provide output or result of function.
           void keyword are used in no return function;void is no return type or null return type;

     2)no return but passing parameter

           but parametirized function can not have any value;

     3)return but no passing parameter
          
           it return always value and print accordingto need;

     4)return but passing parameter

           return keyword are used to declare return function.
           return function always return value and print according to need.


oops:
===========
OOPA stands for object programming system;
oops also provide redunency o f code;
oops provide methodology of perform;
oops have some important piller;
1)class:
=========
class is a collection of object .class is a container which contain data member and data method.
class also called user define datatype;
class keyword are used to create a class.
Syntax
=======
class class_name{
   //data member 
   //data method
}
 2) object
 ===========
 object is a real word entity.which are used to access properties of class.
 object have some properties and features .
 we can create multiple object in a single class.
 Syntax:
 =======
  class class_name
  {
     //data member
     //data method
  }
  Main class{
   class_name object_name=new class_name();
  }
3)inheritence
==============
inheritenceof most imporatnt piller of oops concept.
inheritence is a mechanism in which a class inherite another class property.
column (:)symbol are used to inherite another class in c#;
There are 5 types of inherite
i) single level inheritence
===========================
in single level inheritence,a sub(child) class inherite property of super(parent) class.

ii)multilevel inheritence
=========================
in multilevel inheritence child class access parent  class property and super child access 
sub class property;
iii)multiple inheritence
=========================
This is not supporetd in C#.
because a single child class not inherite multiple parent classs;

iv)heirachle inheritence
+======================+
In this inheritance one parent class and multiple child class can inherite property of parent class;
   
v)hybrid inheritence
=++++++++++++++++=
hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple and multilevel or other inheritance;So multiple is not supporetd also hybrid in not supporetdin C#;
4)Encapsulation:-
=================
In this concept wrapping data in single unit is called Encapsulation.Encapsulation work same like as capsule;
Encapsulation contain member ,method with access modifire;
5)Polymorphism:
=================
Polymorphism is a concept of made by poly and morphsime words
Types of Polymorphism:
======================
i) Run Time Polymorphism
============================
       i)method overloading:
       ======================
          This concept contain multiple method of same name.but having different types of signature;
          signature depends on two types like number of data type and number of parameter;

       ii)operator overloading
       ========================
          operator overloading concept manage operator accordingto need;
ii) compile Time Polymorphism:
==============================
      i)method overriding:
      ====================
        In this concept we can declare same name of method of parent class and also child class;
        child class always override parent class method;

         
6)Data Abastraction:
=======================
     Data Abastraction is a process is used for data hiding internal processof code;
     Abastract keyword are used in data Abastraction;
     we can declare Abastract class and Abastract method in data Abastraction class;
     We can't declare object of Abastract class and contain Abastract method and non Abastract method;
     We know that Abastract ,method can not have method body;
     We can declare method Body on calling Time;

Constructure:
==============
